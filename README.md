# CS523_ZeroWaste

We implement PseNet and compare result with Detectron2 and Mask-RCNN for the ZeroWaste Dataset.

# File Description

## Detectron2
* detectron2_1000.ipynb: Initial Detectron training and and testing model with 1000 iteration
* detectron2_4000.ipynb: Advanced Detectron training and and testing model with 4000 iteration

## PseNet
* data_preprocessing.ipynb: data preprocessing by polygon shrinking
* model_training.ipynb: PseNet training model
* evaluation: PseNet evaluation code
* testing: PseNet testing code


# Running detectron2

Step 1: Open the .ipynb file in Google Colab

Step 2: Upload the dataset file zerowaste-f-final.zip (from https://zenodo.org/record/6412647#.Yk3jaijMIQ8)

Step 3: Running each code segment
